# Scalable iOS UI using UICollectionViewController

In this example, we use a `UICollectionViewController` to position all the videos from a stream in a 2xn grid, and using dual streaming to optimise the video streams received on the local device.

See [Scaleable-UI-iOS-Guide.md](Scaleable-UI-iOS-Guide.md) for detail on how to build up to this, and any important things to consider.
